                        <br>
                        Hi, I'm Carol Sachin Chopde, a first-year Computer Engineering student at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute. I'm passionate about coding and music. Whether I'm problem-solving with code or playing my guitar, I find joy in both the logical challenges of programming and the emotional expression of music. I'm excited to learn and grow in the world of technology while enjoying the beauty of music along the way.

            <b>Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) (Marathi : वीरमाता जिजाबाई टेक्नॉलोजिकल इन्स्टिट्यूट) is a state funded college located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Founded in 1887 and formerly known as the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute, it adopted its present name on 26 January 1997. VJTI is an academically and administratively autonomous institute, but it is affiliated to the University of Mumbai. The institute is financially supported by the Government of Maharashtra.
            <br>
            After being awarded academic and administrative autonomy in 2004, VJTI became operational under the administration of a board of governors. VJTI is also the Central Technical Institute of Maharashtra State. The institute trains students in engineering and technology at the certificate, diploma, degree, post-graduate and doctoral levels.
